# Anamoly-Patterns-in-Videos

Anamoly detection is one of the process in data mining which involves identifying the data points and observations that deviate from a datasetâ€™s original behavior. 
Anomalous data can lead to change in the behaviour and results. The reason for anamolies(outliers) can be noisy data, data pre-processing faults, experimental measurement error etc.
The applications of anamoly detection include fraud detection in transactions, fault detection, spotting potential risks in health data etc.

Machine Learning approach is used because it is easier to gather, clean and analyze huge data. ML algorithms can process most types of data.
Python language was used to extract features from the raw data, train the data and for testing new data.

The data received was in the form of videos. For extracting the features, I had to use dynamic images. The dynamic images were obtained by converting the videos into them.
Later, after extracting the features, the data was spilt in a 70-30 manner(70% training data and 30% testing data).
Various convolutional architectures has also been tested.
